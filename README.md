Back in the day, people had fun turning "recipes" into surprise images using typewriters.

Use the provided recipe to create a recognizable image.

Chunks in the recipe are separated by a space.
Each chunk will tell you either
nl meaning NewLine (aka Carriage Return)
~or~
how many of the character and what character

For example:
4z means zzzz
1{ means {
10= means ==========
5bS means \\\\\ (see Abbreviations list below)
27 means 77
123 means 333333333333
(If a chunk is composed only of numbers, the character is the last digit.)

So if part of the recipe is
2* 15sp 1x 4sQ nl
...that tells you to show
**               x''''

and then go to a new line.


Abbreviations used:
sp = space
bS = backSlash \
sQ = singleQuote '
and
nl = NewLine
